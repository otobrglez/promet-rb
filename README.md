Just hacking promet.

## Experimenting with jRuby

This GEM contains 2 implementations of decoder (deobfuscator). Ispired by [zejn/prometapi](@zejn/prometapi) Python implementation. One threaded and one that is not. Threaded implementation replaces regular one if [jRuby](http://jruby.org/) is detected. Threaded implementation should be 2 times faster. :P
